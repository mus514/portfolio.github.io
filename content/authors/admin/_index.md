Data Scientist with a strong foundation in math and computer science. I earned my Master dergree in **Data Science** from **HEC Montréal** and a Bachelor degree in **Actuarial Science** from **École d'actuariat - Université Laval**, giving me a solid background in analytics.

Currently, I'm diving into the world of **Data Engineering** as an intern at **Bombardier**. My focus is on optimizing **ETL** pipelines, and I'm proud to say that I've trimmed down file migration times to **Microsoft Azure** from **48** to just 8 minutes – a significant efficiency boost for handling complex tasks. I've also been instrumental in creating libraries for automated ETL processes, which has freed up time for more strategic pursuits. Along the way, I've flexed my expertise in deploying machine learning algorithms. For instance, I had a hand in predicting the impact of chemical components on golf course conditions during my time at Laval University.

I love taking on new challenges and getting involved in innovative projects. If there are any opportunities that match my skills and experience, I'm excited to explore and contribute to your organization's success.

Let's connect and chat about how I can bring value to your team!
