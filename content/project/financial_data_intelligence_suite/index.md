title: Financial Data Intelligence Suite
summary: In this project, I employed data engineering techniques and financial quantitative methods. The central focus involves automating the retrieval of financial data through APIs, with daily updates scheduled via crontab on a local machine. The gathered data is transferred to Azure Data Storage in its raw format. Activating Azure Data Factory triggers script execution in Databricks, emphasizing data cleaning and transformation to produce meaningful datasets The refined data is then utilized for visualization and predicting stocks prices, establishing a comprehensive pipeline for effective financial data analysis and informed decision-making.
