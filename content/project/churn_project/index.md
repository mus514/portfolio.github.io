title: A STUDY OF BANK CUSTOMER CHURN
summary: I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to delve into the behavior of bank customers. Employing advanced machine learning techniques, I focused on developing predictive models to ascertain whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The model achieving the highest F1 score is Gradient boosting, reaching an accuracy of 91%. This initiative aimed not only to understand the patterns in customer behavior but also to implement proactive measures for predicting and preventing customer churn within the banking context.
